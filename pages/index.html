                <h2>About me:</h2>
                <p>Hello! I am a Full-Stack Web Developer and recent graduate from the Coding Dojo, where I achieved certification in the MERN Full-Stack. Also, I am currently enrolled in the Tek Systems Boot Camp, where I am continuing to learn more about HTML, CSS, React, Java and other technologies. When I am not studying or doing classwork, I like to spend time with my wife, two-year-old son and friends. I am trying to become the best version of myself that I can possibly be, to grow as a creative problem-solver and to help others whenever possible. So far, coding has helped me learn to be a more patient individual who can overcome challenges with different approaches and ideas. Soon I would love the opportunity to continue my personal and professional growth working as a Full-Stack Web Developer.</p>
